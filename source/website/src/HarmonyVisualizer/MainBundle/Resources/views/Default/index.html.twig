		<h2><span>Context</span></h2>
	    <p>This survey is being conducted for a university project which involves creating a visualisation of version control systems (VCS) data, namely git, in order to facilitate the identification of workload distribution between developers on a given project. This survey is a part of an empirical study which aims to evaluate the usefulness of our visualisation tool when compared to raw data (in table format).</p>

	    <p>For this analysis, we chose two Apache projects: <i>cordova-plugin-file-transfer</i> (project A1) and <i>cordova-plugin-contacts</i> (project A2).
	    This visualisation represents the distribution of developer contributions to the components of a project. We define a developer as any person having contributed to the git repository of the project, and component as a folder in the projects filesystem which contains at least one file that is not of directory nature.

	    During the course of this survey, we will be taking into consideration the level of experience and status of the subjects that are answering the questions.</p><br>
	    
	    <h2><span>Experimental Protocol</span></h2>

	    <p>In order to underline an eventual difference in efficiency between our visualization and a tabular view, we need to compare the time efficiency of both views on different test subjects. Thus, one test group will be provided with the visualisation of project A1 and the tabular equivalent for project A2. The second test group will be provided with the opposite combination.</p><br>

	    <h2><span>Note</span></h2>
	    <p>For better readability, you may need to take this survey in fullscreen mode (press F11).</p><br>
