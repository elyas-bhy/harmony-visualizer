\subsection{How Developers Develop Features\\ \textit{T. Girba, O. Greevy, S. Ducasse (CSMR'2007)}}

In 2007 the same team published this paper\cite{Girba2007}, on a similar subject as the previous. This time, they shifted their focus towards ownership of features as well as files. The visualisation displays the ownership of files within the projects features, which are also structurally linked. The following image is a representation of this visualisation on a program that is designed to manage a mobile phone:

\end{figure}

This visualisation makes it possible to determine whom one might ask in order to help resolve a bug in a feature, rather than having to identify which file belong to which feature as one would need to do with the previous paper's visualisation[cite appendix1].
