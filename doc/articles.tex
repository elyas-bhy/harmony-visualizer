\section{Related Works}

First of all, we need to go over some definitions for this part of our paper. In this section, we will be speaking of metrics, which are measures of some property of a piece of software. There are several metrics that can be calculated in software, but we will mainly be talking about \emph{ownership} and \emph{focus} in the following sections.\\
Ownership is defined as \emph{a general term used to describe whether one person has responsibility for a software component, or if there is no one clearly responsible developer}\cite{DontTouchMyCode}. In our study, we also define a component as a set of software artifacts (mainly files), and a contribution as a modification on a given component.
