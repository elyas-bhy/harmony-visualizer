\section{Conclusion}
	During this study we were hoping to develop a tool which would help determine workload distribution in a much more efficient way that raw data.\\
	However, our study has not produced any conclusive results yet, and so we are only left with our own observations.\\
	We realised while developing this tool, that as the size and number of developer increases, it becomes more difficult to read the information, because it requires more and more scrolling. However, we also noticed that with open-source projects, the majority of developers are often rather insignificant, with less that 5 commits each. Therefore, it might be possible to regroup these developers, and represent them as one or several developers, with little to no consequences.\\

	Furthermore, some information present in the visualiser requires some searching, and is not always immediately obvious, requiring a great deal of searching, such as selecting each component in turn, and even trying different combinations. This makes it difficult, without the results of the study, to determine whether or not our tool is more efficient than the table in these cases.\\

	The question remains, whether or not there are things to improve in our tool, but once again we lack data to know for sure where our tool falls short of expectations, making it difficult to anticipate improvements.
