\section{Introduction}

 As students in software engineering, specialized in project management, we are quite interested by all the information that can be extracted from a source code repository. Indeed, that data can easily enlighten the manager about the project state, by laying bare the development process. 

After the acquirement of more knowledge about ownership and focus metrics, acquired from a number of articles, namely (cite 1, 2, 3), we also understood that we could extract even more information than brut data, depending on how we structure the visualisation of this data.

Thus, once we have explained the main points of the articles we were interested in and exposing what knowledge they bring, we will describe the visualisation we chose to develop, Harmony Visualiser, which shows the workload distribution in a project, we will then expose the protocol and the results of an empirical study conducted in order to measure the efficiency of this visualisation.
